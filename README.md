## ChatGPT Clone for Coding Readme
Welcome to the ChatGPT clone for coding! This repository contains code for a chatbot built using the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) language model, designed to help with coding-related questions and problems.


Customization
The chatbot's responses can be customized by modifying the data in the intents.json file. This file contains a list of potential user inputs and corresponding responses.

Additionally, you can further fine-tune the model by re-training it on a custom dataset. The model is built using the transformers library and pre-trained on a large corpus of text. To re-train the model, you can use the train.py script and provide your own training data.

Contributing
If you find a bug or have a suggestion for improving the chatbot, feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request.
